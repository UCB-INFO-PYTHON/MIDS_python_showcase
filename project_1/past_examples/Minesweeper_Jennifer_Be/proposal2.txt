Project Idea: Minesweeper

A spin of the popular game, with a customizable board, playable on the terminal.

Features:
- Can change flags into different symbols (♥, ☺, ☃)
- Can choose to play a classic round: (Beginner (8x8, 10 mines), Intermediate (16x16, 40 mines) and Expert (24x24, 99 mines))
- or choose their own board size (up to 26x26) and mine amount (not exceeding the square count + 1)
- Saves user's information, so that you can view your scores

Python Files:
- main.py: the interface, where you begin the game and User database is initiated and saved.
- minesweeper.py: where all of the classes live

Classes:
- User: has functions that keep track of the user's score, change board default settings and themes, and begin playing the game.
	VARIABLES: name, win, loss, theme
	FUNCTIONS: loses, wins, quits, scores, change_theme, create_board, change_board, play
- BoardGenerator: instantiates a Board with the correct settings (row, column, mines, theme)
	returns a blank board and answer key
- Board: stores information about the board
	the board you play on, stores many variables (all the different squares), and is moved by Move class
- Move: a class to organize all of the moves: check_move, make_move, flag_move, is_valid_move
	"end": brings you back to the beginning screen
	"flag" xx: puts a flag on the grid position xx
	"unflag" xx: unflags the grid position xx
	"check" xx: checks the grid position xx
	"help": prints out all of the valid commands and moves
- Square: parent class for all types of squares
- Revealed(Square): Keeps track of all of the revealed squares, so we know what to print out on the board (hint or 0).
- Unrevealed(Square): Keeps track of all of the unrevealed quares, so we know what to print out on the board (.).
- Flagged(Square): Keeps track of all of the flagged squares, so we know what to print out on the board (flag keys).
- BlankSquare(Square): Keeps track of all of the Blank Square groups because if you correctly reveal a blank square, it should reveal all of the blank squares touching it.
