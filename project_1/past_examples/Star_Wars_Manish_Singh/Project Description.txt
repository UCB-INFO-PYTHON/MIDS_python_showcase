Star Wars Video Game Project DescriptionThe Game* The object of the game is to find and rescue Princess Leia, who was captured by Darth Vader.* The player starts by getting his starfighter damaged by an asteroid, and has a choice of entering an escape pod (>95% chance of survival) or staying in the ship and crash landing (50% chance of survival) o After this, the player finds a new starfighter and must travel from planet to planet in   order to locate the Princess. A map of the miniaturized galaxy is below. o The player may only travel to neighboring planets, as determined by the map below. o Once the player reaches the Death Star, he must fight Darth Vader. o As the player arrives at new planets, there is a chance that they will get attacked by the enemy dwellers of the planet.ClassesThese classes will definitely be included, but more may be added later in development.* Player Ð the playerÕs information. The player may choose to play as Han Solo or Luke Skywalkero Attributes: health, weapon, weapon damage, name, and sidekick (Chewbacca for Han Solo, R2-D2 for Luke Skywalker). o Methods: hit(damage) Ð subtracts from the playerÕs health during a fight* Characters Ð the various characters that are part of the game, including the enemies that can attack the player and the friendly Wookies and Ewoks who can heal the player o Attributes: health, weapon, weapon damage, name, catch phrase (spoken during a fight).* Planets Ð the planets a player may travel to. o Attributes: name, probability of being attacked, enemies, message (description of planet), neighboring planetsI am also including a hidden feature where if a player visits the planet Naboo, Jar Jar Binks follows him around for the entire game, saying something annoying in nearly all situations (so far: traveling, fighting, winning a fight).I believe that this game sufficiently meets the demands of the project, as it will successfully implement multiple classes and is able to accommodate a variety of situations. The player has many choices that can be made, and there is an element of chance in whether the player will enter a fight, crash or survive, etc.Code so far:#STAR WARS ADVENTURE GAME!#Manish Singhimport osimport timeimport numpy as npimport sysclass player:	def __init__(self, character):		if character == "Luke":			self.name = "Luke"			self.last_name = "Skywalker"			self.weapon = "Lightsaber"			self.weapon_damage = 5			self.partner = "R2-D2"		elif character == "Han":			self.name = "Han"			self.last_name = "Solo"			self.weapon = "Blaster"			self.weapon_damage = 8			self.partner = "Chewbacca"		self.health = 10	def hit(self, dam):		self.health -= damclass character:	def __init__(self, nam, weapo, damag, catch_phras, heal):		self.name = nam		self.weapon = weapo		self.damage = damag		self.catch_phrase = catch_phras		self.health = heal	def hit(self, dam):		self.health -= damclass planet:	def __init__(self, nam, probab, ene, mess, neighb):		self.name = nam		self.message =mess		self.neighbors = neighb		self.probability = probab		self.characters = enedef lose():	os.system('clear')	print("GAME OVER.")	print("You have lost, and Darth Vader has won.
