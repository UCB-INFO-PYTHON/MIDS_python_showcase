# python_project_showcase

*The Berkeley Masters of Data Science project showcase*

We get some pretty incredible projects from our python for data science course. We have chosen the best of them to put in this public facing showcase. There are two types of projects in the showcase

 - Project 1 - An object oriented code base

 - Project 2 - Data analytics

---
Students are allowed to see the examples of these projects to give them an idea of expectations and what is possible. as a result of this we see progressively better projects every semester. Because of this temporal effect projects are sorted by semester.
